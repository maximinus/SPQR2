SPQR II
=======

Player controls Rome
Game is turn-based
Map is region based


Turn Sequence
-------------

Player is given a card, and player must play a card
Player can attack. Enemy attacks are after each player attack
Player can then move long range
Player can spend money
Next emperor is chosen


Regions
-------

Each region has:
	A major city
	A culture stat (gives culture)
	A money stat (gives money)
	A manpower stat
	A "loyalty to the emperor" stat


Troops
------

	Troops have an attack and defence
	Fights are determined by:
		* Ratio of troops
		* Attack vs defence rating
		* Generals ratings
		* Luck


We need:
--------

	The map, split into regions
	The cities / ports and other things to be drawn on the map
	Images for all the unit types
	Stats and names for all the regions
	Some way for the AI to work


Milestone #1:
-------------

	Get a drawn map on screen.
	Allow map to be scrolled / moved around with cursor and mouse
	Click a region and see stats on sidebar

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021 coding: 7th August 2021):
		* Cursor keys move smoothly ✓. Should be fast ✓ and fluid
		* Middle mouse grab overules keys and also moves smoothly
		* Click detection by lookup on texture
		* MapRegion is a class instanced from json data ✓, it is stored in a meta "engine" class
		* Stats are UI, make it a simple text box and get the sizing right for now ✓
		* The UI is going to need a dropshadow, and insetting a little
		* Not clicking a region should clear, not hide, the UI

Milestone #2:
-------------
	Add cities and roads to the map (some artwork needed here)
	Click on a city shows other stats (probably the spend, whilst the region stats shows income)
	GUI overlay shows current year and a person (the emperor) - get the layout right

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021)
		* Not all regions need roads between them.
		* Cities should be easy enough. Like an icon probably
		* They'll need to be pulled from json again
		* The stats are likely to be:
			- Size
		* When clicking a city or region, the stat panel should be the same size and display both sets of stats
		* ESC brings up a menu (this is a ton of work, it means "decide the UI look and do it")

Milestone #3:
-------------
	Add units
	Allow movement
	Turn: Move units -> click turn button

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021)
		* Needs to some easy to read a display of strength on the map
		* Click on them replaces region data
		* Allow a unit to move ONCE. 1 move away with no road, and 2 with a road
		* You need to display the move options AND calculate them. A ton of work!

Milestone #4:
-------------
	Add front end.
	Enable save / load
	Solve and set any resolution / windowing issues

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021)
		* Mainly this is switching scenes and data manipulation
		* Only allow a set number of saves
		* Add scenarios (a save with some flavour text)
		* SPQR is about old shit. No need to jazz the UI up, just make it work and easy to use


Milestone #5:
-------------
	Add cards
	Always have X cards (a card can give you more.. or less)
	You must play a card at the start of each turn
	You are given a random one after playing

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021)
		* Make the cards simple - just text!
		* Player will need a way to see the cards - add a button and some bar showing current empire info
		* There really should not be a lot of "screens with menus", the game should aim to present choices, not endless build options for endless cities
			- By which I mean, I don't the player micro-managing. They need to play the game turn by turn based on the options they have.

Milestone #6:
-------------
	Add select emperor
	At the end of a turn, the new emperor is selected

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021)
		* Apart from the overlay, this is more or less graphical for now

Milestone #7:
------------
	Add a way to spend money
	This means having a budget screen
	Bad emperors might prevent access to this screen!
	Improve buildings, religion, imports, military, food

	Details (started writing:7th August 2021)
		* Rather than a screen that is always viewable, make it a flow
		* Will see after getting the emperor (and before being abke to move)
		* Will see after combat - correct your mistakes
		* Combat is blocked in this turn - you'll need to add to the "next turn" button

Milestone #8:
-------------
	Make the cards and emperor stat changes work
	Show "people", generals, emperor or consuls on side panel
	Restrict attacks to where these people are

Milestone #9:
-------------
	Add combat, and keep it simple!
	It should be definitive more than attritional
	This will need some animations

Milestone #10:
--------------
	Go back and improve steps #1 -> #9 and finalise each step.
