List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not
This is essentially the "how I will program the game" document


Short Term:
-----------

Editor Improvements:

✓ Make sure the correct roads are drawn
✓ When a unit is clicked, all the possible move nodes are highlighted. Consists of:
✓ Work out what nodes can be travelled to
✓ Highlight those modes in some way
✓ Draw the moves as arrows
✓ Update the editor to save road positions
✓ Make moves white, increase arrow length and slightly thinner
✓ Highlight the nearest move possibilty (calculate against the POINTS, not the image)
* Move move selection to unit node
* Move current ESC screen to instead use 'M'
* Can be cancelled with ESC
* Allow movement to be selected
* When route chose, units move
* Add sounds, maybe smoke 3D effects (smoke on floor maybe?)
* Add slight pause so move cannot accidentally be made straight after
* Playtest and make it "pop" and work with no obvious issues
* Fix bug where camera can see sky when at top of mapboard
* Code cleanup:
*	Decide how id should be handled. Consider adding more functions to data
*	Document what knows about what, how ownership is decided etc
* This completes part 1 of "Goals for v0.2"


Couldn't really be solved (add to issues):
------------------------------------------

* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
	The easy methods do not work on our models as we suffer edge splits
	Replaced with "highlight the unit"
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized
	No obvious solution. Also no major reports. Not sure what to do for this.
	The obvious solutions (vsync, frame buffering) did nothing.


Goals for v0.2
--------------

We now move to a making a game.
Best to implement the most common stuff first, as it's the most important.
	1: Clicking a unit allows you to move it. Any unit, any route. Just have one unit.
		- Just let it float around the map and make it work well
		- you need: Arrows, Sounds, Follow a Path, Select from shown paths, Move in world data
		- Needs to "just work" in the best possible way.
	2: Add an enemy unit
		- you need: show possible danger on routes
		- when moving against an enemy in the same region, it is clearly a battle you want
		- when moving against an enemy in a enemy region, you get to choose what to do (avoid or attack etc)
		- when enemies and Romans are in the same region, show a striped region with the map shader
	3: Add battle screen and battle resolution.
		- Add up the totals, add a random value - there's the winner
		- Some other quesi-random elements for casualties
		- Loser has to go somewhere
		- Show the result as an event and animate any retreating moves
	4: Save the game as simply as possible, and also add load
	5: Add 4 more regions

Goals for v0.3
--------------

1: Add turn based mechanics: after a move, either wait or must move a currently unmoved unit
	- All moves occur in order but "technically" at the same time
	- So all units CAN move at the same time - the "wait" button means "I have finished moving everything"
2: Add basic AI to the enemy to decide to retreat, attack or what-not
3: Enemies can move between your moves. Decide a mechanism
4: Add heuristics to game AI. No need to code war aims, give the goal at the start
5: Add >1 enemy
6: Add 4 more regions

Goals for 0.4
-------------

Complete a years worth of campaigns, with possible multiple leaders.

0.5: Emperors
0.6: Cards
0.7: An economy
0.8: Adding culture in some way - art, literature, religion, laws, music
0.9: Front end, saving, loading, high scores, scenarios, credits, events
1.0: More events, polish and more data

Missing from this list:
	


Music & Sound
-------------

We certainly need little clicks and effects for selections and actions
I think we need music of some form
Better to think of "a sound here would be good" and write them out, rather than think ahead
	- Most of our design is graphic led, so think of how a sound might be useful in that context
	- Card swooshes, "bang" on arrival, leaving sound (on dialogs), click sound when touching things
Background music would be good, but hard to source 5+ hours of free good music that fits with the theme
	- Obvious is slow classical. But we can experiment


Wish-List Of Graphical Improvements
-----------------------------------

I want to make the map feel alive, and your gaming changes it.
So the map starts sparse and then you slowly bring a world to life
Since we have roads, and units move along roads, we know the safe spaces on the map and can draw there.

Cities:
-------

Vary from empire to empire
Show changes in size
Have something animated (a little flag?)
Visually display they have troops

Roads:
------

Can be shown in various stages of upkeep
Can change color

Units:
------

Can see stats overlaid
The Roman units should look Roman
Adding variety with horses and ships

Detail:
-------

We have grass in some places and small rocks in others
The sea is not just plain blue but moves a bit
Boats gently rock up and down
A mountain mesh can be found
Rivers are drawn
Waves lap against the shore
Smoke wafts from camps and factories
Small people do simple jobs
Clouds for fog-of-war for regions you know nothing about
