List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not


Short Term:
-----------

✓ Make sure we have 3 models at a minimum: A Roman, a Greek and a Celt
* Add armies in region to region display
* Capture a click on 3d models (towns, units). This highlights soldiers for now.
✓ Add highlight to army unit
* Experiment with full window
* Get a senator / leader 3d unit and add to map (starts at Rome)
	- This is only ever for a campaign
	- But in a civil war, you'll want all of them displayed?
	- Maybe display as a flag, or better an eagle
	- Always with troops, otherwise we need have another location in the json
* Add 4 regions
* Add some roads
	- Work out how the shader draws these
	- Passing over a massive image isn't that bad
* Make sure everything displayed on the screen is populated from data loaded


Couldn't really be solved (add to issues):
------------------------------------------

* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
	The easy methods do not work on complex models
	Replaced with "highlight the unit"
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized
	No obvious solution. Also no major reports. Not sure what to do for this.
	The obvious solutions (vsync, frame buffering) did nothing.


Medium Term
-----------

✓ Add leaders on left-hand-side
* Make the army data and models
* Finish all current UI layout and handling, which is:
	* All map moving
	* All region highlighting
	* All UI elements
	* All data loaded from json
	* No issues or bugs
* Add a leader figure, allow movement
	- I.e. a campaign
	- Choose leader, choose region to go to
	- Choose to move 1 extra unit
	- Choose to move units next to leader
	- Choose to attack
* Code a move
