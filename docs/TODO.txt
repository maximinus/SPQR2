List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not
This is essentially the "how I will program the game" document


Short Term:
-----------

✓ Add 4 regions
✓ FIX: map joins not joining in images
✓ Add an event: A modal dialog with an image, a question and a range of text answers.
✓ The enemy must have some troops, i.e. models added at startup
* Capture a click on 3d models (towns, units). This highlights soldiers for now.
* Get a senator / leader 3d unit and add to map. Starts at home. It's an eagle on stick
* Add click sounds on events
* Add 4 more regions
* FIX: Godot not displaying map on Windows
* Build at minimum a Windows and Linux release of this
* This is the 0.1 release.


Couldn't really be solved (add to issues):
------------------------------------------

* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
	The easy methods do not work on our models as we suffer edge splits
	Replaced with "highlight the unit"
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized
	No obvious solution. Also no major reports. Not sure what to do for this.
	The obvious solutions (vsync, frame buffering) did nothing.


Goals for v0.2
--------------

We now move to a making a game.
Best to implement the most common stuff first, as it's the most important.
	1: Clicking a unit allows you to move it. Any unit, any route. Just have one unit.
		- Just let it float around the map and make it work well
		- you need: Arrows, Sounds, Follow a Path, Select from shown paths, Move in world data
		- Needs to "just work" in the best possible way.
	2: Add an enemy unit
		- you need: show possible danger on routes
		- when moving against an enemy in the same region, it is clearly a battle you want
		- when moving against an enemy in a enemy region, you get to choose what to do (raid, attack etc)
		- when enemies and Romans are in the same region, show a striped region with the map shader
	3: Add battle screen and battle resolution.

Goals for v0.3
--------------

1: Add turn based mechanics: after a move, either wait or must move a currently unmoved unit
	- Purely to let the player know how it works
2: Add basic AI to the enemy to decide to retreat, attack or what-not
3: Enemies can move between your moves. Decide a mechanism
4: Add heuristics to game AI. No need to code war aims, give the goal at the start

Goals for 0.4
-------------

Complete a campaign

0.5: Emperors
0.6: Cards
0.7: An economy and culture
0.8: More events (this is the start of the cream)
0.9: Front end, saving, loading, high scores, scenarios, credits
1.0: More events, polish and more data


Music & Sound
-------------

We certainly need little clicks and effects for selections and actions
I think we need music of some form
Better to think of "a sound here would be good" and write them out, rather than think ahead
	- Most of our design is graphic led, so think of how a sound might be useful in that context
	- Card swooshes, "bang" on arrival, leaving sound (on dialogs), click sound when touching things
Background music would be good, but hard to source 5+ hours of free good music that fits with the theme
	- Obvious is slow classical. But we can experiment


Wish-List Of Graphical Improvements
-----------------------------------

I want to make the map feel alive, and your gaming changes it.
So the map starts sparse and then you slowly bring a world to life
Since we have roads, and units move along roads, we know the safe spaces on the map and can draw there.

Cities:
-------

Vary from empire to empire
Show changes in size
Have something animated (a little flag?)
Visually display they have troops

Roads:
------

Can be shown in various stages of upkeep
Can change color

Units:
------

Can see stats overlaid
The Roman units should look Roman
Adding variety with horses and ships

Detail:
-------

We have grass in some places and small rocks in others
The sea is not just plain blue but moves a bit
Boats gently rock up and down
A mountain mesh can be found
Rivers are drawn
Waves lap against the shore
Smoke wafts from camps and factories
Small people do simple jobs
Clouds for fog-of-war for regions you know nothing about
