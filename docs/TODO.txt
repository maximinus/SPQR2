List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not


Short Term:
-----------

✓ Draw the current roads
✓ Remove the current road data from the json and use the editor json
✓ Make sure everything displayed on the screen is populated from data loaded
✓ Add 4 regions
✓ FIX: map joins not joining in images
* Add an event: A modal dialog with an image, a question and a range of text answers.
* Capture a click on 3d models (towns, units). This highlights soldiers for now.
* Get a senator / leader 3d unit and add to map. Starts at home. It's an eagle on stick

* The enemy must have some troops, i.e. models added at startup
* Add click sounds on events
* FIX: Godot not displaying map on Windows
* Build at minimum a Windows and Linux release of this
* This is the 0.1 release.
* Post on Reddit, with info
* Make a simple website with blog updates (i.e., a subreddit)


Couldn't really be solved (add to issues):
------------------------------------------

* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
	The easy methods do not work on our models as we suffer edge splits
	Replaced with "highlight the unit"
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized
	No obvious solution. Also no major reports. Not sure what to do for this.
	The obvious solutions (vsync, frame buffering) did nothing.


Medium Term
-----------

✓ Add leaders on left-hand-side
✓ Make the army data and models
* Finish all current UI layout and handling, which is:
	✓ All map moving
	✓ All region highlighting
	✓ All UI elements
	✓ All data loaded from json
	* No issues or bugs
* Add a leader figure, allow movement
	- I.e. a campaign
	- Choose leader, choose region to go to
	- Choose to move 1 extra unit
	- Choose to move units next to leader
	- Choose to attack
* Code a move
* We must add sound into the game at some point. But it needs to be decided how to make the sound.


Music & Sound
-------------

We certainly need little clicks and effects for selections and actions
I think we need music of some form
Better to think of "a sound here would be good" and write them out, rather than think ahead
	- Most of our design is graphic led, so think of how a sound might be useful in that context
	- Card swooshes, "bang" on arrival, leaving sound (on dialogs), click sound when touching things
Background music would be good, but hard to source 5+ hours of free good music that fits with the theme
	- Obvious is slow classical. But we can experiment


Wish-List Of Graphical Improvements
-----------------------------------

I want to make the map feel alive, and your gaming changes it.
So the map starts sparse and then you slowly bring a world to life
Since we have roads, and units move along roads, we know the safe spaces on the map and can draw there.

Cities:
-------

Vary from empire to empire
Show changes in size
Have something animated (a little flag?)
Visually display they have troops

Roads:
------

Can be shown in various stages of upkeep
Can change color

Units:
------

Can see stats overlaid
The Roman units should look Roman
Adding variety with horses and ships

Detail:
-------

We have grass in some places and small rocks in others
The sea is not just plain blue but moves a bit
Boats gently rock up and down
A mountain mesh can be found
Rivers are drawn
Waves lap against the shore
Smoke wafts from camps and factories
Small people do simple jobs
Clouds for fog-of-war for regions you know nothing about
