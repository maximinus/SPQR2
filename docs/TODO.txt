List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not


Short Term:
-----------

✓ Add 4 more regions
✓ Add highlight on leaders
✓ Store army locations (maybe > 1) per region in the json file
✓ Parse, load and display armies via json
✓ Define what an army is, and load that data from json
✓ Make city menu actually work again
✓ Add Year, gold and silver to bottom left of screen
✓ FIX: Leader mouse over highlight currently broken
* FIX: Level zoom seems in wrong direction
* Make sure we have 3 models at a minimum: A Roman, a Greek and a Celt
* Click on army updates the display
* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
* Add a game window minimum size
* Experiment with full window
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized


Medium Term
-----------

✓ Add leaders on left-hand-side
* Make the army data and models
* Finish all current UI layout and handling, which is:
	* All map moving
	* All region highlighting
	* All UI elements
	* All data loaded from json
	* No issues or bugs
* Add a leader figure, allow movement
	- I.e. a campaign
	- Choose leader, choose region to go to
	- Choose to move 1 extra unit
	- Choose to move units next to leader
	- Choose to attack
* Code a move
