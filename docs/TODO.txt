List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not
This is essentially the "how I will program the game" document


Short Term:
-----------

Editor Improvements:

✓ Add background music to world and put new pause menu in world
* Test config file works
* Add troop types to units, and "things" to nodes (port, factory, etc)
	* Primarily to busy up the interface
	* All nodes will need a name now

* Rebuild the sidebar using the theme
	* Nasty but required: clicks on sidebar require zooming to location
	* Sidebar can be clicked off with a key, until next click
* Rebuild events using the theme
	* Should be pretty easy by now
* Rebuild the mini-map using the theme
	* Width must now match sidebar width
* Test unhighlighting the mouse, and click highlights region
✓ Test changing the FOV of the camera
* For the current code dilemma, institute a new rule:
	* A class may READ anything from an owned object, but they must WRITE via the API
	* So a unit has a location, it may use that to read from. But it cannot:
		* Set a value in the location
		* Change the location value itself
		* All write functions have easy to understand names, i.e. move_unit_to_region(unit_id, region_id)

* On move, attacking unit moves right up to enemy unit but does not move into node
* Battle screen is shown with resolution
* When screen is finished and closed, enemy unit dies or moves or stays there
* Then the attacking unit moves straight into the node or retreats to previous node
* When a city is attacked, a siege scene is shown
* A siege can take time, so a unit can be in a state of either SEIGING or SEIGED
* Breaking this takes a battle (SEIGED), or either a battle or a move away (SEIGING)
* When either of these units are clicked, the seige screen appears
* Ownership of region is based off of region + units, not just units
* Document how to make regions, and make 4


Couldn't really be solved (add to issues):
------------------------------------------

* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
	The easy methods do not work on our models as we suffer edge splits
	Replaced with "highlight the unit"
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized
	No obvious solution. Also no major reports. Not sure what to do for this.
	The obvious solutions (vsync, frame buffering) did nothing.


Goals for v0.2
--------------

We now move to a making a game.
Best to implement the most common stuff first, as it's the most important.
	1: ✓ Clicking a unit allows you to move it. Any unit, any route. Just have one unit.
		✓ Just let it float around the map and make it work well
		✓ you need: Arrows, Sounds, Follow a Path, Select from shown paths, Move in world data
		✓ Needs to "just work" in the best possible way.
	2: Add an enemy unit
		✓ you need: show possible danger on routes
		✓ when moving against an enemy in the same region, it is clearly a battle you want
		✓ when moving against an enemy in a enemy region, you get to choose what to do (avoid or attack etc)
		✓ when enemies and Romans are in the same region, show a striped region with the map shader
	3: Add battle screen and battle resolution.
		- Add up the totals, add a random value - there's the winner
		- Some other quesi-random elements for casualties
		- Loser has to go somewhere
		- Show the result as an event and animate any retreating moves
		- Rotate unit during move
	4: Save the game as simply as possible, and also add load
	5: Add 4 more regions

Goals for v0.3
--------------

1: Add turn based mechanics: after a move, either wait or must move a currently unmoved unit
	- I.e., implement more than 1 Roman unit
	- All moves occur in order but each unit can only move once per turn
	- Which simply means "Next Turn" sets the units "can_move" flag to True
2: Add basic AI to the enemy to decide to retreat, attack or what-not
3: Enemies can move between your moves. Decide a mechanism
4: Add heuristics to game AI. No need to code war aims, give the goal at the start
5: Add >1 enemy
6: Add 4 more regions
7: Nodes can have >1 unit
	- Do first
8: Add Naval movement and ports
	- Wowser, a big one

Goals for 0.4
-------------

Complete a years worth of campaigns, with possible multiple leaders.

1: For the Republic, this means:
2: Choose a general / senator per campaign
3: Add them to a unit
4: Add them to battle stats
5: Add fatigue
6: Complete a campaign
7: If the leader dies, choose a new leader
8: Calculate the costs and add a simple budget screen
9: You now have Budget Screen -> Campaign -> Results Budget Screen
10: Allow multiple campaigns (essentially, add a "next campaign" button)
11: Campaigns under the Emperor are either under that emperor or the emperors choice
	* This choice is not as perfect as it sounds

0.5: Emperors
-------------

1: Actually add faces / choices
2: Add the mechanic for buying the seat
3: Add the first events for choosing your successor 

0.6: Cards
0.7: An economy
0.8: Adding culture in some way - art, literature, religion, laws, music
0.9: Front end, saving, loading, high scores, scenarios, credits, events
1.0: More events, polish and more data

Missing from this list:
	


Music & Sound
-------------

We certainly need little clicks and effects for selections and actions
I think we need music of some form
Better to think of "a sound here would be good" and write them out, rather than think ahead
	- Most of our design is graphic led, so think of how a sound might be useful in that context
	- Card swooshes, "bang" on arrival, leaving sound (on dialogs), click sound when touching things
Background music would be good, but hard to source 5+ hours of free good music that fits with the theme
	- Obvious is slow classical. But we can experiment


Wish-List Of Graphical Improvements
-----------------------------------

I want to make the map feel alive, and your gaming changes it.
So the map starts sparse and then you slowly bring a world to life
Since we have roads, and units move along roads, we know the safe spaces on the map and can draw there.

Cities:
-------

Vary from empire to empire
Show changes in size
Have something animated (a little flag?)
Visually display they have troops

Roads:
------

Can be shown in various stages of upkeep
Can change color

Units:
------

Can see stats overlaid
The Roman units should look Roman
Adding variety with horses and ships

Detail:
-------

We have grass in some places and small rocks in others
The sea is not just plain blue but moves a bit
Boats gently rock up and down
A mountain mesh can be found
Rivers are drawn
Waves lap against the shore
Smoke wafts from camps and factories
Small people do simple jobs
Clouds for fog-of-war for regions you know nothing about
