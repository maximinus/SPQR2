List of current goals: Mark with ✓ when done, * when not


Short Term:
-----------

✓ Make sure we have 3 models at a minimum: A Roman, a Greek and a Celt
✓ Add armies in region to region display
* Capture a click on 3d models (towns, units). This highlights soldiers for now.
✓ Add highlight to army unit
* Experiment with full window
* Get a senator / leader 3d unit and add to map. Starts at home. it's an eagle on stick
* Add 4 regions
* Add some roads, and work out how these are generated and drawn
* Make sure everything displayed on the screen is populated from data loaded
* Add a cheeky mountain range as mesh object over Switzerland
✓ FIX: Click on water shows units in region
* This the end of the 0.1 release.

A 2d map, on which are placed:
	Cities
	UnitLocations
	Roads

Cities are a scene that exposes the data requirements for a region
	Since all regions have at least a city location
UnitLocations are where units are placed
We can check against the region image to work out what regions they are in
Roads are 2D lines we render to an Image
We also save the routes, so a unit can walk along the route, and the arrow graphic for moving.
All this is generated to a json file and a dir of images when the scene is played


Couldn't really be solved (add to issues):
------------------------------------------

* Add 3D glow shader to army unit when selected
	The easy methods do not work on complex models
	Replaced with "highlight the unit"
* Fix massive screen-tearing when window re-sized
	No obvious solution. Also no major reports. Not sure what to do for this.
	The obvious solutions (vsync, frame buffering) did nothing.


Medium Term
-----------

✓ Add leaders on left-hand-side
* Make the army data and models
* Finish all current UI layout and handling, which is:
	* All map moving
	* All region highlighting
	* All UI elements
	* All data loaded from json
	* No issues or bugs
* Add a leader figure, allow movement
	- I.e. a campaign
	- Choose leader, choose region to go to
	- Choose to move 1 extra unit
	- Choose to move units next to leader
	- Choose to attack
* Code a move
* We must add sound into the game at some point. But it needs to be decided how to make the sound.



Wish-List Of Graphical Improvements
-----------------------------------

I want to make the map feel alive, and your gaming changes it.
Since we have roads, and units move along roads, we know the safe spaces on the map and can draw there.

Cities:
-------

Vary from empire to empire
Show changes in size
Have something animated (a little flag?)

Roads:
------

Can be shown in various stages of upkeep
Can change color

Units:
------

Can see stats overlaid
The Roman units should look Roman

Detail:
-------

We have grass in some places and small rocks in others
The sea is not just plain blue but moves a bit
Boats gently rock up and down
A mountain mesh can be found
Rivers are drawn
Waves lap against the shore
Smoke wafts from camps and factories
Small people do simple jobs
Clouds for fog-of-war for regions you know nothing about
